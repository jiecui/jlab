function d = dist_to_line( l, p )
% DIST_TO_LINE - calculates distance a group of points is to a line.
%
% Usage: dist = dist_to_line( line, points )
%
% where line is a 2x2 matrix - each row is an [x,y] point.  points should
% be a Mx2 matrix.
%
% The distance returned can be negative, indicating that the point in
% question is below the line.  Use abs if you are just interested in
% distance.
