	Compiling MEX-Files with the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE

Note   This section provides information on how to compile source MEX-files in the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE. It is not totally inclusive. This section assumes that you know how to use the IDE. If you need more information on using the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE, refer to the corresponding Microsoft documentation.

To build MEX-files with the Microsoft Visual C++ integrated development environment (press Alt-F7 for project properties in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 IDE):

   1. Create a project and insert your MEX source files.

   2. Create a .def file to export the MEX entry point. On the Project menu, click Add New Item and select Module-Definition File (.def). For example:

      LIBRARY "myfile.mexw32"    ("myfile.mexw64)
      EXPORTS mexFunction        <-- for a C MEX-file
         or
      EXPORTS _MEXFUNCTION       <-- for a Fortran MEX-file

   3. On the Project menu, click Properties for the project to open the property pages (Alt-F7).

   4. Under C/C++ General properties, add the MATLAB include folder, matlab\extern\include, as an additional include folder.

   5. Under C/C++ Preprocessor properties, add MATLAB_MEX_FILE as a preprocessor definition.

   6. Under Configuration Properties --> General properties, change the output file extension (Traget Extension) to .mexw32 if you are building for a 32¨Cbit platform or .mexw64 if you are building for a 64¨Cbit platform.

   7. Locate (add the directories in Linker --> General --> Additional Library Directories) the .lib files for the compiler you are using under matlabroot\extern\lib\win32\microsoft or matlabroot\extern\lib\win64\microsoft. Under Linker Input properties, add libmx.lib, libmex.lib, and libmat.lib as additional dependencies.

   8. Under Linker Input properties, add the module definition (.def) file you created.

   9. Under Linker Debugging properties, if you intend to debug the MEX-file using the IDE, specify that the build should generate debugging information. For more information about debugging, see Debugging on the Microsoft Windows Platforms.
